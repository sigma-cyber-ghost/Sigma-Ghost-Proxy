## 🛑 ILLEGAL USAGE WARNING — YOU BREAK, YOU BURN

This tool was **not** built for rules.  
It was forged to **penetrate, bypass, and survive**.

Usage includes (but is not limited to):
- Scanning and flooding third-party proxy lists
- Validating live SOCKS/HTTP tunnels for **unauthorized routing**
- Circumventing bans, geofences, rate limits, and tracebacks
- Proxy-chaining into deepnet and exfil paths

You will not be protected. There is no safety net.

> By running this, you accept that:
> - You may violate international cybercrime laws.
> - You are solely accountable for every packet routed.
> - No logs are kept — because fire doesn’t log what it burns.

💀 SIGMA GHOST assumes no liability.⚔️ 
**This is a tool of chaos — not compliance.**
